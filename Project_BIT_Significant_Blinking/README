# 4-bit Countdown Simulation in Proteus

This project demonstrates a 4-bit countdown simulation using Proteus. The 4 bits represent the values from 15 to 1, with each bit turning on and off in sequence to count down from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).

## Overview

The 4-bit system uses 4 LEDs to represent each bit. The LEDs toggle to display the binary values of 15, 14, 13, and so on, counting down to 1.

- **Bit Representation**:
  - **Bit 4** (MSB) is the most significant bit.
  - **Bit 1** (LSB) is the least significant bit.
  
Each bit turns on and off in a pattern that reflects the countdown.

## Components Used

- 4 LEDs (representing each bit)
- Resistors for LED current limiting
- Microcontroller (STM32F103C8) to control the LED states
- Proteus software for simulation


## Logic

The logic of the countdown involves using a simple counter in the microcontroller that starts from 15 (1111 in binary) and counts down to 1 (0001 in binary). Each bit toggles on and off according to the binary representation of each countdown value.

## How to Use

1. Open the Proteus simulation file.
2. Start the simulation to watch the countdown.
3. The LEDs will display the binary count from 15 down to 1, with each bit turning on and off in sequence.
